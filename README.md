#### Security

Please install and run the following security programs as part of your testing process:

### Environmental variables

- The `BRANCH` environment variable indicates in which environment is this application running. Not setting this variable will result in defaulting to `local`.
- The `EDH` environment variable is used as a feature flag, to switch to stub endpoints. 
    A value of of `STUB` will use the stubApiKey and stubBaseUrl.
    Any other value will use the real key/url  
- The `DEBUG` environment variable is used as a feature flag, to enable more extensive logging. Does more logging if value is `TRUE`, otherwise off
- The `VALIDATION` environment variable is used as a feature flag, to enable validation. Does validation if value is `TRUE`, otherwise off
